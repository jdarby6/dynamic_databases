# dynamic_databases
Django App that allows for the addition of databases on the fly and also the ability to query those database's tables through dynamically generated models.

It's a work in progress. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

It currently doesn't allow for the creation of content_type instances for the dynamic models created but I'll look at adding it soon.

Use at your own risk.
